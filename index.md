### Healthcare
[WiDS Datathon Challenge 2020](https://github.com/Reshma-34/WiDS-Datathon-2020)
<br>
The challenge is to create a model that uses data from the first 24 hours of intensive care to predict patient survival. MIT's GOSSIS community initiative, has provided a dataset of more than 130,000 hospital Intensive Care Unit (ICU) visits from patients, spanning a one-year timeframe.

### Virus Prediction
[West Nile Virus Prediction](https://github.com/Reshma-34/West-Nile-Virus-Prediction)
<br>
Given weather, location, testing, and spraying data, predict when and where different species of mosquitos will test positive for West Nile virus (WNV). Predicting outbreaks of WNV in mosquitos will help the City of Chicago and CPHD more efficiently and effectively allocate resources towards preventing transmission of this potentially deadly virus.
