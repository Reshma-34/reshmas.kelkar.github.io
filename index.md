## Data Science Projects

[Predict Accent of a Speaker](https://github.com/Reshma-34/Accent-Classifier)
#### Speech Recognition: CNN, BLSTM
Accented speech poses a major obstacle for speech recognition algorithms. Being able to accurately classify speech accents would enable automatic recognition of the origin and heritage of a speaker. This would allow for robust accent-specific speech recognition systems and is especially desirable for languages with multiple distinct dialects.

[Derive meaningful information from the CORD-19 dataset](https://github.com/Reshma-34/CORD-19)
#### Text Mining: NLP - SciSpacy, Topic Modelling 
CORD-19 is a resource of over 158,000 scholarly articles about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 and coronaviruses. There is a growing urgency for these approaches because of the rapid acceleration in new coronavirus literature, making it difficult for the medical research community to keep up.
The aim is to develop data mining tools that can help the medical community develop answers to high priority scientific questions.

[WiDS Datathon Challenge 2020](https://github.com/Reshma-34/WiDS-Datathon-2020)
#### Healthcare: LightGBM
The challenge is to create a model that uses data from the first 24 hours of intensive care to predict patient survival. MIT's GOSSIS community initiative, has provided a dataset of more than 130,000 hospital Intensive Care Unit (ICU) visits from patients, spanning a one-year timeframe.

[Predict Earthquake Damage](https://github.com/Reshma-34/Nepal-Earthquake-Damage)
#### Geospatial: Clustering, Ensemble Classification Model ( LightGBM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
Based on aspects of building location and construction, our goal is to predict the level of damage to buildings caused by the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal.

[Effect of Lifestyle on Ageing](https://github.com/Reshma-34/Effect-of-Lifestyle-OnAgeing)
#### Healthcare: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
Explore the data to uncover insights around impacts of lifestyle on aging and ailments; specifically, diseases like ‘Arthritis’, ‘Angina’ and ‘Chronic Lung’ conditions.

[West Nile Virus Prediction](https://github.com/Reshma-34/West-Nile-Virus-Prediction)
#### Healthcare: XGBoost, Random Forest, Stacked Model
Given weather, location, testing, and spraying data, predict when and where different species of mosquitos will test positive for West Nile virus (WNV). Predicting outbreaks of WNV in mosquitos will help the City of Chicago and CPHD more efficiently and effectively allocate resources towards preventing transmission of this potentially deadly virus.
